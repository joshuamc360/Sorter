 #Sorter Program
  
  The sorter program demonstrates commonly used sorting algorithms used to create and sort randomly generated arrays on numbers. 
  
  The program does this by giving the user the ability for the user to interact with it by the keyboard to select menu items of different algorithms. Then the user can specify the length of the array they would like. The program creates an array of that length, sorts the array into another, displays them and displays the time the algorithm took in nanoseconds. 
  Once completed the program displays the menu again until the user decides to quit the program. 
  
  
  ##Bugs and Future Improvements 
  -The Binary search tree fails to sort its elements into ascending order so will have to be implemented correctly. 
  
  -Improvements to this will include options for the Binary search tree's other functions to be accessed from the menu. 
  
  -The scope of the test is limited to the sorting algorithms. Test's are needed for the main class's functions. 
  
  -Property-based tests for each algorithm class would be a good way to test many arrays of different values.
